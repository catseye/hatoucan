hatoucan
========

`hatoucan` is a tokenizer for Commodore BASIC 2.0 programs.  You give it a
text file, and it gives you a `.PRG` file, which can then be run on a
Commodore computer (or emulator) such as the Commodore 64 or VIC-20.  It is
written in Python 2.x and its source code is in the [public domain](UNLICENSE).

Quick start
-----------

Usage is simple.  From this directory,

    script/hatoucan <source.txt >program.prg

Alternatively, put the `script` directory somewhere on your search path,
and the script can be invoked simply as `hatoucan`.  (An easy way to manage
this is to use [toolshelf][].)

There is one command-line option, `-l`, which allows the load address to
be specified in hexadecimal.  For example, to tokenize a program to load on
the unexpanded VIC-20:

    script/hatoucan -l 1001 <source.txt >program.prg

If no `-l` switch is given, the load address defaults to `$0801`, suitable
for the Commodore 64.

Why?
----

Given that there are several good options for tokenizing Commodore BASIC
programs already freely available, such as `petcat` which is included in
the [VICE][] distribution, why did I write this?

Well, any reasonable person would probably be wise to just use `petcat`.
But, I wanted a tool that could be included with [The Platform][] that could
tokenize the Commodore BASIC programs that are part of The Platform, namely:

*   the original implementation of [Bubble Escape][]
*   [Dungeons of Ekileugor][]
*   [DiskSumo][]
*   the front-panel simulator from [SITU-SOL][]

and none of the tokenizers I found appealed to me.  `petcat` in particular

*   is licensed under the GPL.  I prefer less parasitic licensing.
*   is bundled with VICE.  (If there is a standalone distribution, I was
    unable to find it.)  I would either need to extract it, or include
    all of VICE in The Platform.
*   has kind of weird command-line usage, if you ask me.
*   is written in C... which is fine, but things written in higher-level
    languages are more "hackable".
*   has support for all kinds of versions and extensions of Commodore
    BASIC.  Which is great, but I don't need all of those extras.

Plus the prospect of writing a tokenizer seemed easy enough, and that did
appeal to me.  After obtaining reference materials, it was basically
finished in a single day.

Of course, it is not very efficient, and only a subset of the `petcat`
special character codes such as `{wht}` are supported.  But it suits my
purposes.

Oh, also...
-----------

`hatoucan` was written in a test-driven manner, using a [Falderal] test
suite for Commodore BASIC 2.0 tokenization.  The tests in this suite
should pass with under `petcat` and `hatoucan`, and, if you find or write
another Commodore BASIC tokenizer, you can use this same test suite to
test it (Falderal tests languages and protocols, rather than particular
programs) â€” simply add an adapter for your implementation to the
`tests/fixture` directory.
